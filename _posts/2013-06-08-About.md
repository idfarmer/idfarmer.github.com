#### Hello,
I am Kyle Lawson, the creator of Assembly Process. This site serves many purposes. It is an experiment in getting my thoughts and opinions out of my head and into the public. It is a home for projects and documentation. And it is an adventure into the land of Jekyll, Github and coding. As the name suggests, this is a process, it will change as it comes together.

#### Background
I am an industrial designer by education. I received my BFA from  The Savannah College of Art and Design. I've worked in different fields: advertising, academia, industrial fabrication & production, biotech, and machine/computer vision, all of which have been incredibly educational and have helped shape my opinions and outlook.
